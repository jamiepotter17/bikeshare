This was a project I made in September 2021 as part of Udacity's ['Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program'](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).

It is a simple Python program that reads from three Bikeshare databases and gives the user summary information. It uses PySimpleGUI for its GUI.

Requirements
* Python 3.9
* Pandas 1.3.3
* PySimpleGUI 4.47.0

This project made extensive use of the documentation and examples supplied at pysimplegui.org. In addition, I benefitted from examples from StackOverflow and GeekforGeeks. No code is copied, however.
